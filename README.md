# Shiny App — Starter for my-first-r-project

This repository contains a minimal Shiny app starter.

Quick start (local)
1. Open this repo in RStudio and create/open the `.Rproj` file (or just open the folder).
2. Install renv (if not installed) and restore the project library:
   - install.packages("renv")
   - renv::restore()  # restores packages from renv.lock if present
3. Run the app:
   - In RStudio: click Run App or
   - In the shell: Rscript -e "shiny::runApp('.', port = 8000, host = '0.0.0.0')"

What’s included
- `app.R` — the Shiny app (UI + server). Upload your data, explore and plot a numeric column.
- `R/helpers.R` — small helper functions used by the app.
- `data/raw/` and `data/processed/` — folders for raw and processed data (placeholders).
- `Dockerfile` — build a container image that serves the app via shiny-server.
- `.github/workflows/shiny-ci.yml` — CI workflow to restore renv and run basic checks/linting.

Deploy options
- shinyapps.io: use rsconnect::deployApp() (add rsconnect configuration for your account).
- Docker: build and run the included Dockerfile to host on any container runtime.
- Shiny Server / RStudio Connect: copy the app directory to the server and configure.

Notes and best practices
- Don't commit large or sensitive raw data. Keep raw data out of git; use data/raw/.gitkeep and add instructions for how to obtain data.
- Use renv::snapshot() after installing/updating packages to update renv.lock so collaborators/CI can reproduce the environment.
- Add tests with shinytest2 for interactive testing if you need automated UI tests.

License
- Add a LICENSE file appropriate for your project.
